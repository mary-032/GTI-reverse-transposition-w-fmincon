The example codes for the algorithm are identical, except that they use the new minute, respectively hour, coefficients of the re-parametrized Engerer2 separation model.
The example data contains the mode that matches the data, that is "1-h" or "1-min".
The output is given both for reverse transposition with Hay & Davies and Perez1990. 

Please make sure you use the correct mode for your data and/or adapt the code for your purposes accordingly.
